            My name is Alberto. My major is computer science. My goal in college is to use the skills 
            I develop here to transfer and eventually find a job position I enjoy. In my spare time, I 
            listen to music, play video games, and exercise. I have attempted to learn HTML in the 
            past, but I never used the knowledge for any personal projects, and most of the information 
            didn't stick with me. I hope to finish this course with a far more complete understanding of 
            the topic and use that knowledge to develop a website I've been conceptualizing for a while.

            <li>Practice drawing</li>
        </ol>

            My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> because there are a lot of videos and music that cater to my interests.
